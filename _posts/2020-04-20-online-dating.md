title: The Sociology of Online Dating

Introduction 
============

Online dating can be defined as a purposeful form of meeting new people
through specifically designed online services. (Barraket and
Henry-Waring 2008) It is analogous to the post-modern era of traditional
purposeful dating techniques mediated by commercial interests, such as
newspaper-based personal advertising and other matchmaking services.

The first online dating websites, such as Web Personals and Match were
launched in the mid-90s. In this period, online dating was still
considered a taboo. The mainstreaming of online dating can be accredited
to media portrayals via movies such as You've Got Mail (1998), for
example. In the early 2000s, websites like eHarmony and OkCupid made use
of questionnaires and bio prompts to help users see who they might be
better suited to.

The smartphone era led to the exponential growth of online dating. Apps
such as Grindr (2009), a proximity dating app geared toward gay and
bisexual men, and Tinder (2012), which popularized proximity dating and
the swipe left, swipe right feature created a whole new culture of
online dating. (T. Staff, n.d.) It vastly increased a person's networks
creating new opportunities to meet people in a way which couldn't be
done without the online world.

Now that we have established that online services have *evolved* the
dating landscape, it is important to analyse the reasons for the same.
This can be done via *critical sociological imagination*. This involves
problematizing based on current societal structures and norms rather
than personal beliefs.(Crossman, n.d.a) Note that In all subsequent
analyses, demographics in developed nations where infrastructure to
enable and sustain online dating on a large scale exists, like US, UK,
etc, are considered as the unit of observation.

![A few online dating statistics ("Love & Technology: A History," n.d.).
Currently, the percentage is as high as  40% ("How Couples Met,"
n.d.)](../../images/stats.png){#fig:label width="46%"}

**What changes in societal norms and structures brought about the boom
of online dating? What did it offer that traditional methods
couldn't?**\
\
In order to answer this question, we need to understand what these
traditional methods are. These include meeting someone through family, a
common friend, finding someone in a public place, like a pub, and more
along these lines. Basically, the *medium of introduction* involved a
physical entity. In online dating, these physical entities are replaced
by commercialised online services. One glaringly obvious impact of the
latter is the direct implication of the *network society* as defined by
Manuel Castells(Castells 2000). Participation in the network society
increases our connections vastly and this very fact is leveraged by
online dating services. This brings down the various barriers present in
online dating such as reliance on the third party to facilitate an
introduction. The sites are on all the time and you can engage whenever
and wherever you want. (Ansari 2015)\
\
**How has the perception of dating and romance evolved with the changing
structures?**\
\
Modern romance can be considered analogous to Daniel Bell's theory of
the paradox of modern consumerist capitalism; i.e., the rising
importance to instant self-gratification over the quality of a
relationship (Bell, n.d.). In Aziz Ansari's thorough discussion with
senior participants(Ansari 2015) who found romance through the
\"traditional\" means, it was clear that they had a rather *pragmatic
approach*. which is illustrated by the proximity of the places where the
romantic partners came from, as well as by the conditions they had to
fulfil to be eligible for marriage (job security, family background
etc). Modern romance on the other hand tends to enforce a rather
*hedonistic notion* that \"a special someone is out there for
everyone\"(Botiková 2015). Online dating platforms' discourse that this
special someone is just \"a few swipes/clicks away\" lays the foundation
for such an idea. Paradoxically, the combination of high demands and
seemingly endless possibilities of choice result in people staying
single, yet still full of hope. These platforms rely on garnering a
large audience, by providing low entry barriers(Lin, n.d.), to sustain
themselves economically. The discourse provided by these platforms are
purely out of commercial motives, but these permeate even through
existing social structures.\
\
**Who are the people who use these services? What sorts of people
prevail in this era of online dating?**\
\
We can analyse this question from three perspectives - age, gender and
sexual orientation.

-   *Age -* Reports (Smith, n.d.) show an increased participation in
    almost all age groups, but interestingly, in the age groups of 18-25
    and 55-64. This shows that the penetration of online app/website
    based dating services is through a variety of age groups! This also
    shows that the well reported *stigma* behind online dating
    (Ansari 2015) is decreasing and it's being widely accepted as the
    norm in modern romance.

-   *Gender -* It's apparent that there are gender gaps prevalent in
    dating apps, which varies from app to app, country to country, also
    age group to age group. (Labelle, n.d.) If we dig deeper, we can see
    that the gender skew is more prevalent in the 18-25 age group. It is
    this very age group that also shows the highest dating app usage
    (Smith, n.d.). These gender gaps have also led to the curation of
    gender favoured dating apps such as Her (Labelle, n.d.). These
    gender gaps will be analysed more closely in a further section.

-   *Sexual Orientation -* Online dating has seen immense success in
    proliferating through \"thin markets\"(Ansari 2015; "Swiping Right:
    How Smartphones Changed Relationships," n.d.). These thin markets
    include the LGBT community, where statistics have shown that nearly
    70% of LGBT couples meet online. This because these apps provide for
    a 'safe space to meet' (coverit, n.d.). The traditional dating
    methods, like meeting at bars, nightclubs etc, for the LGBT
    community poses big barriers in the form of hate crimes,
    discrimination, etc (Geller, n.d.). Online services offer a safer
    and discreet way of meeting romantic interests. They also provide a
    more personalised view of potential partners as they offer filters
    based on sexual orientation. This serves as an important point of
    analysis as these apps are playing an important role in shaping
    queer communities.

The rest of the article will include analyses of online dating under the
lenses of social spaces, social relations and social institutions. I
will then connect these by using the sociological concept of
*prosumption* as the basis for permeation of the technology of online
dating in this digital society.

Body As A Digital Space 
=======================

The human body has long been a site of quantification. Our experiences
on digital platforms have created seemless, individualised embodiments
of ourselves through enhanced forms of quantification facilitated by
digital media. Online dating services too have a role in how human
embodiment is configured and represented online.

The basic requirement of dating apps is the creation of a *profile*. For
example, Tinder, the most popular dating app in the market, requires a
user to create a profile by adding a few photos and adding an optional
self-descriptive text (Tinder, n.d.). The user also has to enable
location services and select an age range. This profile forms the basis
for digitised *embodiment*. Users are shown profiles which match their
selection criteria, and presents them in a seemingly random order. Other
popular apps such as Hinge have a more detailed profile setup where the
user has the option to add \"conversation initiators\" in addition to
adding pictures. An important fact to note here is that the swipe-based
matching applications are much more widely used than apps such as Hinge
("Most Popular Online Dating Apps in the United States as of September
2019, by Audience Size," n.d.). One common aspect in all sorts of dating
apps is that it establishes a \"self-other continuum\" as the app takes
in a user's data (the profile) and presents to the user, potential
matches. This kind of a simplified model of human embodiment can result
in a coarse representation of the individual, which provides a limited
and often skewed perspective (Boyd 2001, 2003). *Deception* plays a key
role in online dating. eHarmony statistics show that 53% of online
daters lie on their profile. The fact that these deceptions are possible
creates a paradox of disembodiment because what's being shown may not
even be a true subjection being portrayed to us. The regularizing factor
to this, however, is the fact that the environment of dating
applications is geared towards potential romance.(Ward 2016; Monica
Anderson and Turner, n.d.) Despite this, the lack of accountability and
a lack of 'fear of rejection'(Derek A. Kreager and Yu 2015) results in
undesirable activities on these platforms (Monica Anderson and Turner,
n.d.). These factors reduces the users' trust on these services,
creating a gap in the self-other continuum.

It's been well documented that physical proximity between people still
remains an important factor even in online dating(Barraket and
Henry-Waring 2008). Dating apps keep track of the user's location
information to ensure that potential matches are shown in the proximity
of their location. This is possible because we carry our phones wherever
we go! Thus, there also is a place-space continuum created by online
dating platforms. This ubiquity also enforces a cybernetic experience
because of the role the virtual space has imposed on our physical lives.

Online dating can be viewed as a space in which embodied experiences
resulting in the formation of intimacies is mediated between the virtual
and the physical space(Barraket and Henry-Waring 2008). The permeation
of digital media in this very intimate matter of our lives is a true
example of *digital cyborg assemblages* that are thriving in the digital
society (Lupton 2014). The role of initiation which was either
face-to-face confrontation at a public place or the medium of a common
friend has been replaced by the digital dating application. Other forms
of intimacies, such as sexual relations, romantic dates etc, have also
been permeated by the digital medium, in the form of sexting, virtual
dates, etc, something which is becoming increasingly prevalent in these
times of lockdown. These permeations of the digital sphere into the
physical sphere form the basis for digital cyborg assemblages and the
cybernetic posthuman.

Online Dating Under The Lens of Gender 
======================================

There is a significant amount of discourse on gender equality and the
mediation of gender roles as an outcome of ICTs and digital
platforms(Green and Singleton 2013). Under these conditions, analysing
gendered technologies such as online dating is critical to explain how
gender roles have evolved in the post-feminist, digital age.

*Stereotypes -* There is a notion that online dating has made it a level
field for gender roles by mediation(Deng, n.d.a), however, the data
shows that traditional gender roles are still alive and well, albeit, in
an analogous form(Byager, n.d.). Traditional gender roles dictate that
men are generally socialized toward valuing, being involved in multiple
sexual relationships, and playing an active role in sexual encounters,
while women are expected to value a more passive sexual role and to
invest in committed relationships(Tolman, Striepe, and Harmon 2003). We
can clearly see parallels to this as studies have shown that men send
more messages to women, and men are also more likely to initiate
conversation. Furthermore, when a woman initiates conversation, their
response rate drops(Millward, n.d.; Deng, n.d.b). Attractiveness too
plays a major role, as even a man at the highest attractive percentile
barely receives the number of messages almost all women get(Ansari
2015). This shows that age old traditional notions about gender roles
are reinforced rather than mediated by online dating applications. Men
play out the role of seekers, and women cautiously choose who they
prefer to 'match' with amidst the vast pool of seekers.

*Harassment -* According to biological evolution, men have massive
amounts of testosterone coursing through their bodies, pushing and
driving them toward sexual expression based on physical desire whereas
women's sexual desires come from the mind(Watson, n.d.). These gender
characteristics are morphed even in online dating platforms. According
to statistics by Pew(Monica Anderson and Turner, n.d.), women,
especially in the 18-34 age range, face an increased amount of sexual
harassment on these platforms. This can be attributed to the fact that
there is virtually no accountability on these platforms. Users can
remain virtually anonymous while messaging their matches, and thus can
easily get away with their actions, as the most that can happen is their
account getting blocked. Also, the *psychological costs*(Rachel Dinh and
Yasseri 2018) (such as fear of rejection) involved is vastly reduced.
These factors combined with the established biological notion for men
result in the creation of a space where new forms of online sexual
harassment can thrive online.

These stereotypes aren't just implicit in nature. Dating sites like
eHarmony, for example, provides tips for users when creating their
dating profile with certain distinctions made between the tips for men
and those for women that reinforces traditional gender roles. The
eHarmony staff recommend both genders to post multiple photos, however
men are told to so others can \"get a sense of who \[they\]
are,\"(eHarmony Staff, n.d.a) whereas women should post multiple photos
because men want to \"check \[them\] out\"(eHarmony Staff, n.d.b). Thus,
propagation of gender stereotypes also lies in the economic interests of
these platform providers.

The gender gap in usage can also be attributed to the above analyses, as
women are overwhelmed with matches and harassment leading to
discontentment(Monica Anderson and Turner, n.d.). The skewed gender gap
makes the situation even worse as the involvement of men remains the
same, thus further increasing the amount of messages women get. Hence, I
argue that mediation of gender roles in online dating is merely a myth;
rather gender roles are getting further polarised due to reduced
barriers of accountability and skewed gender participation introduced by
these spaces resulting in the permeation and advancements of stereotypes
in the form of harassment.

These technologies are *\"technologies without guarantees\"*, as they
introduce new capacities, by *leveling the romantic playing field for
women*(Deng, n.d.a), while aggravating existing tensions in a different
space as we have seen. The notion that *\"The more things change, the
more they stay the same\"* is very appropriate under the lens of
gender(Chaudhuri 2020).

Dating Platforms As A Sharing Economy 
=====================================

We have seen that dating platforms provide the service of enabling
people connect to people they are interested in and allowing them to
develop a romance. A vast majority of these applications are free to
use, despite which they are thriving economically and forming a fast
growing industry("Dating Services," n.d.). Thus, it is important to
analyse how the commercial interests of these platforms permeate through
the construction of romance.

Although dating applications are free to use, how do they make money?
This can be analysed by viewing these platforms as a *sharing economy*.
So, what is a sharing economy?

Investopedia defines sharing economy as *\"an economic model defined as
a peer-to-peer (P2P) based activity of acquiring, providing, or sharing
access to goods and services that is often facilitated by a
community-based on-line platform\"*(Chappelow, n.d.; Irving, n.d.).
According to Tom Slee(Slee 2015), there are four aspects to a sharing
economy :

-   they are peer-to-peer platforms that provide a service of merely
    *connecting* end users

-   they depend heavily on reviews and rating systems in order to
    regulate the service

-   they turn users into micro-entrepreneurs

-   they take a non-market phenomenon powered by human relationships and
    turn them into a market exchange

Dating applications indeed enable two users to connect, and offer
nothing more than that, making it purely P2P. They don't curate or
manage dates, they only provide the connection. This philosophy employed
by online dating platforms has many consequences. As seen in the earlier
section, there is a huge amount of sexual harassment on these platforms,
particularly against women users. This is because of the *laissez-faire*
approach taken by these profit-seeking technologies which results in
their denial of any responsibility through the idea that their platform
is merely the service, not the end "product" people seek by engaging in
it --- a date(Irving, n.d.).

Reviews and rating systems form a crucial part in the sharing
economy(Ravenelle 2016). These systems enable platforms to determine
which users are more 'desirable' so that they can show up in the
swipee's queue of profiles. Tinder's algorithm, for example, uses a
variety of factors based on a user's 'production' on the app to assign a
'score' to each user("Tinder's Algorithm -- How It Determines Who Gets
to See Your Profile & What You Can Do About It." n.d.). However, there
is a difference between Tinder's rating system and those of other
sharing economies like eBay and Airbnb. Tinder's rating systems are
private as opposed to the typical public ratings based 'hands-off'
regulation. But the purpose remains the same, that is, to ensure that a
user has a good experience on the platform, and to 'weed out' users
based on his/her production as well as the interactions other users have
with his/her profile on the platform.

The success of a user on these applications depends on the investment
they put in making their profiles, regularly participating, and
interacting with connections (or matches); a concept that is coined as
*'dating capital'*(Irving, n.d.). This is where the concept of
*impression management*, which forms a vital part in a sharing economy,
comes in(Ravenelle 2016). Users market themselves through their profiles
to attract 'customers'. This bears a resemblance to *human capital*,
where an investor seeks to maximise the return on an asset where we
ourselves are the asset. Foucault describes human capital as a theory
under which the worker "appears as a sort of enterprise for himself".
This concept can easily be extended to dating platforms where people who
invest enormous amounts of time, energy and resources into their own
human capital, learn to present themselves as available and desirable.
The creation of such a capitalist market space in the space of dating
results in uneven outcomes and users thinking in economical terms. The
difference between dating platforms and traditional sharing economies is
that the economy for users is not money, but the number of matches,
likes, messages etc. Thus, the dating space has been quantified into a
capital-based market place where we have to put in huge 'investments' on
ourselves to get an appropriate 'return'.

The Sharing Economy model aims to find an aspect of human relationships
that can be re-conceptualised as a problem of exchange and replace it
with an algorithm-driven market. This is exactly what dating platforms
do. They took the problem of people trying to search for a companion and
converted it into a market phenomenon where the value that is traded is
dating capital and desirability. In this way, a romantic relationship is
re-modeled into a competitive 'free' market.

The way these applications make money in the created sharing economy is
by providing a few paid features(Deutsch, n.d.) which give users a sense
that buying these will give them a competitive edge in the market. Thus,
these platforms rely heavily on participation on the platforms and
ensuring the 'free' market space stays competitive for all users without
them losing hope. A direct implication of this is that people are always
on the look out for 'something better'. This results in fleeting
relationships as people feel don't stay content with what they have.
Trust plays an important role in a sharing economy, but establishing
trust on a sharing economy without public ratings is hard; rather, it
becomes a thriving place for scammers. This can be easily seen, as
people are facing an increasing amount sexual harassment on these
platforms.

Prosumption in Online Dating 
============================

We can notice a common theme in all the topics discussed so far. Users
play a key role as they not only *consume* the services of these
platforms, but also *produce* data. This is the concept of prosumption.
The most obvious way users do so is by creating their digital identities
and participating in the network of daters. The means in which we
participate in the network include not just the creation of a profile
but also 'liking' potential matches, sending messages, etc. The network
can sustain itself in this seemingly laissez-faire manner only because
of users' production on these networks.

An analysis of user data collected also reveals trends which are usually
written off by the hype and other forms of discourse by the platforms.
One such analysis includes the permeation of gender stereotypes in
online dating (discussed earlier). Dating applications such as Bumble,
where girls have to send the first message, arise in the market in order
to provide an alternative and expose such trends(Krieg, n.d.).

Prosumption also forms the basis of a sharing economy. Our investments
(production) on the app dictate our return (in the form of likes,
matches, messages). Thus, by merely producing data, users also end up
acquiring a sense of capital (dating capital), a sense of emotional
'rich'ness of sorts. The basis for algorithmic regulation is in user
data. Tinder's algorithm, for example, uses a rich variety of user data
to determine a 'score' for each user ("Tinder's Algorithm -- How It
Determines Who Gets to See Your Profile & What You Can Do About It."
n.d.). Thus, the invisible hand of the free market is, in reality, a
deterministic algorithm, making the so called free market not so free
after all. These applications also use user data for 'targeted
advertising'(Duportail, n.d.); one of the most important sources of
revenue for such 'free' applications. This brings back the Marxist
notion of *alienation* from the product of our labour; our data(Comor
2010; Groote, n.d.).\
\
\
This article aims to dig deeper into the so called *Gemeinschaft*
community(Crossman, n.d.b) created by dating platforms. A human
phenomenon which is so vital to our existence has now been commodified
and turned into a market which is marred by mistrust. The focus has
shifted from romance to accumulating dating capital to gain a perception
of richness which in turn results in new forms of gender inequality as
well as increased polarisation of even the present gender stereotypes.
In a methodological sociological approach, we have seen the deeper
implications of online dating and its impact on diverse actors in this
digital society.
