title: Power Relations in the Web
excerpt: >-
  This article aims at understanding how power shapes our perspectives
  in the web. Before getting into the discourse of power, we first
  attempt to understand the web itself and how it plays a role in our
  lives. This is done by viewing the web as a socio-cognitive space
  within which power operates. We then try to analyse power relations by
  relating to Michel Foucault's accounts of a disciplinary society and
  governmentality with respect to the web and the processes which
  operate in the web. Lastly, we analyse how the agency of these
  processes can be understood.

Introduction
------------

The web has been long thought of as a space which enables the
deconstruction of hierarchies due to its technical architecture, i.e.,
*a flat space* (Oxenford, n.d.). Arguments against this claim can be made
by analysing the topic under the lens of access to the web. However,
this article attempts to address power relations that exist even
*within* the web. As the web is now being viewed as a *socio-cognitive
space* where users themselves are a part of the web, we can draw
analogues of the web to societal structures which in themselves are
socio-cognitive spaces that very much subsume us. Thus, just as power
relations form a significant part of societal structures (Connolly 2020),
an analysis into power relations in this *network society*, as coined by
Manuel Castells (Castells 2000), are important so that we can effectively
understand the cognitive impacts of the web.

Web as a Socio-Cognitive Space 
------------------------------

Before we get into power itself, we first need to understand and
formulate a model of the web in which power relations proliferate.
Viewing the web as a socio-cognitive space seems appropriate for this
cause. Initially, the web was seen as a tool that was completely
separate from users. Humans were seen more as consumers rather than
contributors. However, since the advent of *Web 2.0*, human
participation became the central aspect of the web. This participation
happens explicitly  (blogs, tweets) and implicitly  (cookies, phone
sensors). As a result of this, at present, the web draws more data from
us than we draw from the web! Users have thus become very much a part of
the web. Thus, the web is no more merely just a tool, rather a
ubiquitous space where it's not just interactions between users that
take place. The web uses the data we generate to interact with us
through algorithms. Such a construction of a space results in humans
being cognitively affected by the web even if we want it or not. The two
main proponents which are drivers of this space are *data* and
*algorithms*. Thus, the web can no longer be seen merely as a
technological construct, but also a social construct.

The Power of Data and Algorithms 
--------------------------------

Firstly, it is important to establish the notion of power itself before
we get into the discourse of it. To create a proper understanding of
power, it is only appropriate to seek recourse to Michel Foucault's
theories of power. It is important to note that power by means of
coercion and a showcase of supremacy is not what we are concerned with.
This is rather an archaic representation of power. The shift from this
kind of a visual offering of symbolic power is marked by changing the
focus on to the individual as an object of knowledge (Gutting and Oksala
2019). According to Foucault, the goals of power and the goals of
knowledge cannot be separated: 'in knowing we control and in controlling
we know' (Gutting and Oksala 2019).

The present day web draws many analogues with Foucault's description of
a disciplinary society (Krasmann 2017). The three characteristics of such
a space are observation, normalising judgement, and examination (Gutting
and Oksala 2019). A direct form of observation would be government
surveillance. Various geopolitical models of the web (O'hara and Hall
1)    feature surveillance irrespective of their position on the
political spectrum  (Edward Snowden's revelations about the NSA, China's
authoritative internet, etc). This can be viewed as an analogue to
Bentham's *panopticon*. However, the central observation tower of the
Panopticon model is in this case dispersed and inconspicuous as
technologies have become omnipresent. The root of these surveillance
mechanisms are data and algorithms and they serve both commercial and
state interests. State interests lie in things such as anticipating
criminal interests, but commercial interests are based on addressing and
invoking consumer desires. Examples of this include Netflix's
recommendation engines, Google's personalised advertisements, etc. The
premise of truth onto which the power of algorithms are vested on is the
fact that they act on the data that we produce on the web. Thus, the
outcomes produced by algorithms become or reflect wider notions of
truth. Power then is operationalized through the algorithm, i.e., the
algorithmic output cements, maintains or produces certain truths and
these discourses are circulated in the web. From this perspective,
algorithms might be understood to create truths around things like
riskiness, taste, choice, lifestyle, health and so on (Beer 2017).

Also, clearly, since the web draws data from us, we, the users, have
become the objects of knowledge. This data is further presented back to
us in order to subjugate us to the 'truth'. This procedure is utilised
by the power structures of the web to manipulate and objectify the user
in order to subjugate his/her power to know the truth, all via
surveillance (Rajagopal 2014). The web creates what Foucault calls
'instrumental knowledge', i.e., scientific knowledge and expertise
related to new technologies and their operation --- software or
hardware, rather than real awareness and intellectual knowledge/wisdom.
Use of instrumental knowledge may entrap unaware users.
States/corporations, could legitimize the erosion of individual's
privacy under the false pretext of 'public good' (Rajagopal 2014).
Examination on the other hand aims at eliciting truth and controlling
behaviour (Gutting and Oksala 2019). One way that this process is
undertaken in the web is with the help of *socio-cognitive incentives*.
An example of this would be the manner in which Google offers virtual
rewards as an incentive for people to review a place they visit, or
Twitter adding fake news labels to false information. These are examples
of direct intervention to keep a check on deviant behaviour. However,
the very nature of the web and its control mechanisms facilitate the
eliciting of the so called truths by networked actions. This effect is
noticed in Twitter's hashtags for example. There often seems to be a
collective emotivist response to content on the web, which are further
enhanced by algorithms who seem to have the agency to heighten or even
diminish certain content.

So far, our discussion has been about *disciplinary* power which can
feel rather hegemonic. However, Foucault also talks about power in the
form of subjectivity and resistance (Gutting and Oksala 2019). This move,
which he calls *governmentality*, allows us to explain the role of
resistance in the modern day control society. Governmentality involves
the creation of subjects, and in the case of the web  (which is a
socio-cognitive space), the very subjects that are prevalent in the real
world are mapped directly on the web space as well. Thus, the web
constitutes the production of subjects, social relationships and
associations. Also, along with the creation of subjects, the framework
of the web also allows for the immanence of discourse which further
shapes action  (which in turn facilitates the creation of knowledge) .
Thus, power is not just merely hegemonic, but it's ontological (Krasmann
2017). Actors on the web have a fairly low bar to be called an active
object in this process of power shaping, because even the smallest of
decisions we take in our lives are manifest on the web as a digital
footprint which forms the input for algorithms; all thanks to the
ubiquity of the web  (and the rise of *social machines*) (Smart 2016). In
order to better understand the creation of subjects and critique on the
web, we can look at the web as a hierarchy of *opinion
drivers* (Bhanushali, Subbanarasimha, and Srinivasa 2017). According to
this model, the inner core consisting of social machines facilitate
discourse with the help of the 'trigger' level  (media houses, online
news outlets etc) and these two layers in turn seek information sources
from the 'inert' realm  (Wikipedia, Project Gutenberg etc). Here, we can
clearly notice the process of subject creation and facilitation of
critique in the web in a rather ontological manner. All kinds of actors
end up shaping this dynamic process irrespective of their activity on
the web. For example, we can directly take part in the discourse around
subjects on social machines, or by merely browsing the web, our
footprint on the web can be utilised for statistical analysis  (for
example) which can in turn feed discourse. Thus, power relations are
dynamic and permeating in nature and shape the way we perceive the ways
of the world.

Agency of Algorithms 
--------------------

We have seen how data and algorithms shape  (and possibly hold) power
relations in the web. The main critique of the web currently is the lack
of transparency of these algorithms and in the collection of data. This
opaqueness is what gives rise to discussions about the role of
algorithms in the deployment or expression of power, leading to the
notion of a 'black box society' (Beer 2017).

While it is true that the decisions taken by algorithms are shaping the
way we think and perceive the world, it's important to also understand
that we have to look deeper when we ask ourselves about the power vested
in them. Rather than focusing on algorithms themselves, we need to hold
the people behind these processes accountable. In the section on
governmentality, we have seen how power structures enable the creation
of subjects. People often rely on 'experts' to dictate these norms and
define what is normal and what is deviant (Greene, n.d.). When we
internalise these norms and identify ourselves with the subjects/labels
that have been assigned to us is when power is most invisible and most
powerful. This can be seen as a direct observation with the processes in
the web  (the growth of *internet centrism* (Chatfield, n.d.))! Thus,
clearly, these 'experts' who in the web space include data scientists,
fact checkers, content makers, etc should have a sense of responsibility
and awareness so that they can ethically dispatch the power they hold.

Thus, the people behind the processes on the web should embrace the fact
that their actions hold immense power, and it is vital for them to have
an understanding of these technical processes in concurrence with their
social implications. This can be achieved by understanding computer
science as a social science field rather than merely viewing it just as
a technical field (Connolly 2020).
