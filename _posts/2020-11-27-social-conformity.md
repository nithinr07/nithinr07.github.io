  This article addresses the well known phenomenon of social psychology
  known as social conformity vis-a-vis information cascades. First, we
  understand how conformity takes the form of a mild persuasion
  technique. Then, we formulate what an information cascade really is
  and understand a few properties associated with them. The last section
  deals with a case study of two real world examples of information
  cascades : The Sahara chit fund scam, and the QAnon conspiracy theory.

Introduction 
============

As the global society is increasingly visualised as a network of
connections between people, it is important to analyse the effects of
this network on an individual, i.e., how people in a network influence
each other's behaviour and decisions. Social Influence theory ("Social
Influence: Conformity, Social Roles, and Obedience," n.d.) can be used
to analyse these network effects on people. According to this theory,
persuasion lies can be mild (conformity) or strong (obedience). This
article addresses network effects of social influence under the lens of
*social conformity*.

Conformity is the covert process by which an individual voluntarily or
involuntarily changes his/her belief or behavior in order to fit in with
a group (McLeod, n.d.). An example of social conformity would be a
scenario where you do your research and determine that restaurant A is
the best in the vicinity, so you intend to go there. However, on
arrival, if you notice that the neighbor, restaurant B, is packed with
people while restaurant A lays barren, you may tend to join the crowd at
restaurant B despite the fact that your private information indicates
that restaurant A is the better option. This example shows very clearly
the psychological driver of *herding* that humans possess. To analyse
these conformity effects further, the construct of *information cascade*
is used, from which some interesting properties can be derived under the
lens of social psychology.

Information Cascades 
====================

An information cascade is a situation when an individual, having
observed the actions and possibly payoffs of those ahead of them, takes
the same action regardless of the private information that they possess
("Information Cascades and Observational Learning," n.d.). The key
element of an information cascade is *sequential* decision making. When
people make decisions sequentially, later people who observe these
decisions infer something about what the earlier people know. In the
example of the restaurant, the person possessed private information with
the aim of going to restaurant A, however, on seeing more people in
restaurant B and none in A, the diners already in B conveyed information
about what they knew. A cascade is formed when people abandon their
private information in favour of inferences based on earlier people's
actions (David and Jon 2010).

Humans are known to have a deeply rooted predisposition to imitate which
comes from an evolutionary instinct of survival (in numbers)
(Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, and Welch 1998). However, it is important to
note that this isn't just a mindless and irrational imitation.
Information cascades can be the result of drawing rational inferences
from limited information. Taking recourse to the restaurant example, as
the number of people in restaurant B increases, higher is the tendency
to conform. The rationale behind this is that the latter people tend to
think that the people in restaurant B know something that they don't.
Such an imitation may also occur due to the social pressure to conform,
without any informational cause as well. It's difficult to tell the two
apart.

Broadly, there are two different sets of rational reasons for
information cascading to occur.

-   *Informational effects :* As discussed in the restaurant example,
    these are the cascade effects that occur when the actions of others
    affect a person by changing his/her private information cues due to
    the notion that the group may know something that he/she doesn't in
    a similar situation.

-   *Direct-Benefit effects :* The rationale involved here is that one
    may tend to copy others if there is a direct benefit to that person
    by aligning with the common behaviour. Here, the notion of private
    information may be absent or replaced altogether by the cascade
    effect.

It is important to note that the above two can work independently,
hand-in-hand or even conflicting with each other. For example, in a
scenario where a new technology has been released, information from the
cascade (others possessing the technology) as well as an evaluation of
our direct benefit in adopting this technology come into play. However,
in the restaurant example, suppose there is a long line outside
restaurant B, and we still choose to stand in the line rather than
follow the private information cues about restaurant A, we are favouring
the informational effects of the cascade over the inconvenience caused
by waiting ("Information Cascades and Observational Learning," n.d.).

A lot of experiments(mathematical and observational) have been done to
understand the effects and implications of information cascades. A few
of the implications are ("Information Cascades," n.d.; David and Jon
1)    :

-   *Cascades can be wrong :* When there is a situation where accepting
    a notion is in fact a bad idea that can reduce one's utility, even
    if only the first two people accept this, a cascade of acceptances
    will start to propagate. This can be confirmed by Solomon Asch's
    conformity experiments (Cherry, n.d.)!

-   *Cascades can be based on very little information :* People ignore
    their private information once a cascade starts and larger the
    cascade, greater the lure. A cascade can be started by just two
    people! This implies that if a cascade starts in a large population,
    most of the private information available to the people is not being
    used.

-   *Cascades are fragile :* Since large cascades can develop just by
    very little information, it also makes them easy to stop. Thus,
    people in such cascades can be made to alter their decisions in the
    presence of slightly superior information, thus overturning even
    long-lasting cascades.

An interesting point to note is that according to James Surowiecki's
*The Wisdom of Crowds* (Surowiecki 2005), aggregate behaviour of many
people who individually possess limited information can produce accurate
results provided each individual takes an independent decision. However,
a group of people making a decision sequentially is highly prone to
cascading, which as we have seen, can lead to incorrect outcomes.

This process of *social learning* (Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, and Welch
1)    has been long observed in society. As the philosopher Eric Hoffer
asserts:

> "When people are free to do as they please, they usually imitate each other\.... A society which gives unlimited freedom to the individual, more often than not attains a disconcerting sameness. "

Case Studies of Information Cascades 
====================================

Information cascades have an effect in various social realms such as
market theory, politics, crime and enforcement, etc ("Information
Cascades," n.d.; Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, and Welch 1998). In this
section, two such case studies shall be analysed:

## Marketing Strategies 

Marketers are known to use the idea of information cascades to enable a
*buying cascade* to develop for a new product. The idea here is to
induce an initial set of people to adopt the new product, then those who
make purchasing decisions later on may also adopt the new product even
if it is no better, or even worse than competing products all thanks to
the cascade effect. This process is most effective when later customers
are able to observe just the decision to adopt the product rather than
their review of the same. This is consistent with the idea that cascades
arise naturally when people can see what others do but not gain access
to the private information that they hold.

This phenomenon was strongly leveraged by groups such as Sahara in their
chit fund scheme ("Sahara Scam: The Story of Trust and Betrayal," n.d.).
At first, a small pool of people invested in the chit fund and even got
the promised returns. This set off an information cascade based on the
foundations of trust seen only by this small pool of people. The speed
at which the number of people investing into the chit fund was very high
and all of it was based on very little information on the returns to the
investment as experienced only by the initial small group of investors.
The important feature here is that the Sahara Group gained a lot of
trust merely by the power of numbers it attracted in the form of small
investors. The information cascade kept rolling until public information
broke the trust. After it was revealed to the general public that the
chit fund was a money laundering scam, the cascade could no longer
persist and the trust that people had broke down along with it.

## Conspiracy Theories on Social Media 

Social media and the tremendous capacity it has for the flow of
information amongst people has made it a very fertile source for the
growth of information cascades. At present, it has become increasingly
and speedily possible to mobilise people towards a certain cause on
social media (Lewis, n.d.) (Twitter and trending hashtags, for example).
This inherent property of social media is taken advantage of to
propagate material such as conspiracy theories. One such conspiracy
theory is QAnon (Wong, n.d.). This theory started off as a series of
anonymous posts in the microblogging platform 4chan. At present, the
QAnon community is vast and is not only limited to the online world, but
has also permeated into the physical, political realm as well. So, how
did this happen? This can be explained by the theory of information
cascades. At first, the traction for the theory was slow and small in
number, but with time and the spread of information through the growing
network, the number of believers in the theory soared rapidly,
especially in 2020. Donald Trump, a powerful beacon of influence, was
central to the theory, and could have de-legitimized it by shunning it,
as we have seen how information cascades can be fragile. However, he
never backed away from the theory, which further led to the believers of
QAnon to internalise their beliefs.

Here, we can see many properties of information cascades as mentioned in
the previous section. As the number of people invested in the theory
grew, the more force of validation it received thus making newer
audiences to believe in it. This was also possible because of the *echo
chamber* effect of social media. People who identify themselves as
'right wing' were prone to getting dragged into the rabbit hole of this
conspiracy theory. We also see how this cascade was formed out of little
to no information as well. Just the sheer size of the cascade was enough
for it to gain legitimacy.

Conclusion 
==========

In this article, we have seen the inevitability of social conformity in
the form of information cascades due to the innate psychological driver
of herding that we possess. These properties are leveraged well by
corporates and people as well which, as we have seen, can lead to
devastating consequences. Using our own private information to come up
with an independent decision without getting influenced by cascade
effects can lead to people making better choices. This is possible only
by being aware of the effects of information cascades especially in a
digitally connected world where the flow of information is immense.
