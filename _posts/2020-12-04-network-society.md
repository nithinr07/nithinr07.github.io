Introduction 
============

Over the past decade, the world is showing increasingly heightened
amounts of connectedness. This has been enhanced mainly with the advent
of ICTs which made it easier to create and sustain far-flung networks in
which new kinds of social relationships are created. The Spanish
sociologist Manuel Castells coined the term *network society* to
describe this societal phenomenon (Castells 2000). Analysing these
network structures prevalent in society is important to understand the
underlying socio-psychological cues that are taking shape. Previous
research was focused on treating the online social network completely
separate from the offline world (Naseri 2017). However, this presents a
rather outdated view as the distinction between the online and offline
networks is quite blurred. At present, the use of *Social Network
Services* (SNSs) has enabled the efficient management of social networks
and thanks to the ubiquity of the internet, this online social network
very much permeates into the offline realm as well and the two can't be
treated independently.

The abstractions of triadic closure, strong and weak ties (Granovetter
1973; David and Jon 2010) provide a good basis for the analysis of
social networks. In this article, these abstractions are given the added
dimension of the notion of *social capital* in order to understand the
socio-psychological attributes of present day social networks.

Social Capital 
==============

Firstly, what is capital? Capital consists of any human-centered asset
that can enhance one's power to grow and ensure stability. One way to
look at it is capital growth enables the upwards progress in the
*Hierarchy of Needs* (McLeod, n.d.) Social capital is one of four types
of capital which broadly refers to \"the norms and networks that
facilitate a variety of social transactions and help individuals and
groups to fulfil mutually held goals\" (Schafft and Brown 2003). This
notion is also captured by the age old adage *it's not what you know,
but who you know*. However, social capital is a notoriously hard term to
define while going deeper into this generic idea. According to Pierre
Bourdieu, social capital refers to \"the aggregate of the actual or
potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable network
of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance
and recognition.\" (Naseri 2017) Thus, Bourdieu views social capital in
terms of an individualistic, symbolic power, in that people with more
social capital hold more power, enabling social stratification. Putnam,
however, regarded social capital as an attribute of society. According
to him, social capital refers to the \"features of social organization-
networks, norms, and trust-that enable participants to act together more
effectively to pursue shared objectives\" (Geber, Scherer, and Hefner
2016). In sum, social capital can be thought of as the resources
available in networks of formal and informal relationships on which
individuals and society as a whole can capitalize.

Mark Granovetter's notion of strong and weak ties can also be embedded
within our notion of social capital as the tension between closure and
brokerage. Putnam elegantly defines these two as *bonding social
capital* and *bridging social capital* (Naseri 2017; David and Jon
2010). Bonding social capital directly correlates to the notion of
strong triadic closure and entrenchment property of social networks
while bridging social capital refers to the weak ties that arise in
social networks. Thus, bonding social capital refers to the entrenched
networks which provide emotional support and trust and less novelty.
Bridging social capital on the other hand yields informational gains but
low emotional support. The focus of this article will be on how these
forms of social capital is nurtured and cultivated via social networking
services.

Impact of SNSs on Social Capital 
================================

SNSs are "web-based services that allow individuals to (1) construct a
public or semi-public profile within a bounded system, (2) articulate a
list of other users with whom they share a connection, and (3) view and
traverse their list of connections and those made by others within the
system" (Steinfield, Ellison, and Lampe 2008). The advent of such
services has made implicit notions tied to social networks very much
explicit. For example, as is well-known to users of social-networking
tools, people maintain large explicit lists of friends in their profiles
on these sites --- in contrast to the ways in which such friendship
circles were once much more implicit, and in fact relatively difficult
for individuals even to enumerate or mentally access (David and Jon
2010). Similarly, engagement involves features such as liking, tagging
etc. These notions introduced by SNSs have a profound impact on social
capital via technology mediation.

Traditional research on social capital has shown the benefits people can
get from their social networks; strong ties provide them with emotional
support (bonding capital), and weak ties provide them with non-redundant
information and different perspectives (bridging capital) (Utz and
Muscanell 2015). However, these assumptions might no longer hold true as
individuals now tend to have larger and more heterogeneous networks, and
they can communicate in varied and newer ways than previously. Sites
like Facebook enable directed communication and information sharing
thus, research has shown that strong ties provide for both social and
informational support, and also due to better relationship maintaining
strategies, higher utility can be drawn from weak ties with social media
(Utz and Muscanell 2015). Information obtained from entrenched networks
on social media has a lesser tendency to be limited because of the sheer
amount of weak ties available to each node of the entrenched network.
This also means that the number of strong ties on these networks are far
lower than the number of weak ties, as weak ties are easier to maintain
unlike strong ties which require the continuous investment of time and
effort to maintain. The causal dependency of traditional weak ties is
also mitigated as they don't require continuous maintenance to survive.
Also, the rise of communities for particular causes which resonate with
a user's identity can allow them to join what seems to be an entrenched
network, but with no necessity to continuously maintain and interact
within the online community. Thus, weak ties can even provide a sense of
emotional support along with informational gains. All this implies that
the traditional distinctions of bonding and bridging capital and their
analogy with strong and weak ties is hugely diffused (David and Jon
2010).

Another observation pertains to the effects of *online disinhibition*
(Suler 2004). Social media is known to mobilise people for civic and
political engagement easily. This is due to the fact that weak ties can
easily be established and maintained on these services. However, the
causal sustenance of these online movements is very limited due to
various reasons including the technical designs of SNSs (Couldry 2015).
However, the psycho-social impacts of disinhibition due to social media
is another major factor. Longer term political campaigning requires
sustained resources and higher amounts of strong ties which are hard to
maintain on online social networks as seen earlier. However, thanks to
the availability and transmission of information and the lack of
restraint the user feels in online environments, it is easier to
mobilise people for a short period of time. Putnam discusses that one
major cause of decline in social capital is the constant and permanent
reduction in number of individuals willing to join voluntary
associations. SNSs make it easy to establish associations, however these
are based on relatively weaker ties and lesser accountability and thus
can attribute to the reduction of social capital in the longer term.
Further research is needed to properly understand these effects.

It has also been shown that people with lower self-esteem tend to draw
maximum utility from SNSs due to lower barriers for initiating
communication leading to the formation of weak ties, mitigating fears of
rejection (Steinfield, Ellison, and Lampe 2008). This provides evidence
for the \"poor-get-richer\" theory. This has led to the massive
permeation of SNSs in various dedicated spheres of our lives such as
dating, professional networks etc. Notions of herding and territoriality
is also present in the analysis of social capital facilitated by SNSs.
Externally visible aspects of SNS behavior, including number of friends
and posted pictures, were related to the explicit power motive, but time
invested in SNS activity (to maintain relationships), a non-visible
aspect of SNS behavior, was related to the explicit affiliation motive
(Heser, Banse, and Imhoff 2015).

Conclusion 
==========

Social capital is a rather rich description of the underlying network
structure for both individual nodes as well as a collection of nodes.
Only primitive research has been done in this area as it is only
recently that the implicit notions around social capital have become
rather explicit thanks to the advent of SNSs. This article deals mainly
with concepts related to tie strength which is just one metric of social
capital. The notion of social capital thus provides a framework for
thinking about social structures as facilitators of effective action by
individuals and groups, and a way of focusing discussions of the
different kinds of benefits conferred by different structures (David and
Jon 2010).
