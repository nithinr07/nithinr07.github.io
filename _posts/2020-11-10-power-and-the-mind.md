Introduction
------------

In the previous article (Raj, n.d.), we have seen how power can be viewed
as an omnipresent entity in the web and, largely, in the social sphere.
This article will deal with the intricacies of how power relations shape
our world view by understanding the impact of power on the mind. This
can be done effectively by understanding the dimension of power and the
role it plays in the cognitive abstraction of the human mind.

Firstly, what is *power*? Power generally encompasses the *ability to
do/enact*. Power has been conceptualised in terms of the potential to
influence others (Dépret and Fiske 1993). Power relations are common in
the social world and forms one of the major components of our
lives (Dépret and Fiske 1993; Guinote 2015). These asymmetries play a
pivotal role on the ways individuals feel, think and act (Dépret and
Fiske 1993). Thus, power forms an important dimension which can be
analysed under the lens of cognitive science so that a better
understanding of the impact of power relations in our lives can be
achieved.

Theories of Power
-----------------

From an evolutionary point of view, the construct of power in a social
arrangement enabled the resolution of *group-solving functions* (Guinote
2015). However, the possession of power (or the lack thereof) has shown
certain impacts on our cognitive selves which are even manifested in our
physical actions. The three theories of power discussed below give an
insight into how power impacts our cognition.

-   *Approach Theory of Power :* According to this theory, power results
    in a positive emotional state of the working memory, yielding
    positive, dis-inhibited outlooks. This reward-seeking behaviour
    implies that power directs attention towards rewarding
    stimuli. (Keltner, Gruenfeld, and Anderson 2003; Dépret and Fiske
    1993; Guinote 2015)

-   *Social Attention Theory :* This theory states that power holders
    try to minimise their cognitive usage while making judgements. Thus,
    social actors tend to conform to stereotypes to relate to broader
    social aspects because of the readily available heuristics
    associated with stereotypes. (Dépret and Fiske 1993)

-   *Situated Focus Theory :* This theory also proposes that power
    affects motivation and information processing in ways that lead to
    more situated responses. Power holders are said to be reliant on any
    accessible constructs. They process information selectively in line
    with the constructs loaded in the working memory on a
    moment-to-moment basis as opposed to their powerless counterparts
    who tend to deliberate more to get to a judgement. (Guinote 2015;
    Dépret and Fiske 1993)

It is important to note here that these these theories aren't
independent of each other. They try to model behaviour observed in the
real world. The accessibility of constructs can be based on a *top-down*
or a *bottom-up* view. Top-down (internal) orientation refers to
goal-attainment, subjective experience, motivations etc whereas the
bottom-up (external) view refers to the environmental cues which are
perceived and acted on by the mind. The social attention theory
emphasizes mainly on the top-down view of power holders, whereas the
situated focus theory claims that both the bottom-up and the top-down
constructs are acted upon by power holders. Experiments based on these
theories are conducted with the help of *priming*. Power is an attribute
than can be primed onto a set of people. (Dépret and Fiske 1993)

Cognitive Analysis of Power 
---------------------------

In this section, we shall explore how power impacts each of the elements
of the cognitive toolbox. Broadly, people with power can construct
judgements based on any readily accessible heuristics unlike powerless
people who tend to deliberate more to get to a judgement, i.e., power
holders readily utilise *System 1* responses to get to a judgement
whereas powerless people tend to rely on the more reasoned *System 2*
response.

Firstly, how is the loading and morphing of constructs from the long
term memory to the short term memory impacted by power? It is important
to note that power holders are often primed to a positive emotional
state as they are in a reward-rich environment. Thus, power holders have
frequent access to goal-oriented ends and work to achieve these with the
constructs that get activated  (chronically or temporarily). The
powerless, however, tend to forage more as they do not possess
goal-orientations and are often on the look out for threats. As a
result, power increases the *selectivity* of construct activation
leading to the efficient pursuit of goals (Dépret and Fiske 1993).

Once constructs are activated, they are used to guide judgement and
action. Power holders tend to trust accessible constructs readily in
contrast to powerless individuals who tend to deliberate and seek more
evidence before making judgements (Guinote 2015). As a result of this,
power can decrease a person's tendency to conform to group opinions
 (conformation bias), and they are also less affected by persuasive
messages, unlike their powerless counterparts. Power also clouds the
mirror neuron effect as the mind tends to anchor perspectives too
heavily on their own vantage point (Guinote 2015). Also, power holders
tend to rely on episodic constructs that get activated, i.e., subjective
experiences and even these guide their judgements. In addition, it is
important to note that power holders don't only act at will. In the
absence of prior goals, environmental cues can heavily impact the
judgement made by power holders. This is in line with the situated focus
theory of power. In summary, power holders show greater trust in their
judgements and apply any accessible constructs than powerless
individuals.

Secondly, how does power affect the cognitive tool of *attention*?
Attention serves as the pathway between perception and the constructs
that are activated. When in a power position, individuals naturally save
their attentional resources, paying attention only to information that
aids the satisfaction of their needs or the attainment of goals or
paying attention to information that is salient in the
environment (Dépret and Fiske 1993). This is achievable because power
also facilitates a positive emotional state reducing the need to forage
for threats. Thus, power holders possess the ability to selectively
focus attention on the constructs activated from a moment-to-moment
basis. Thus, they have the ability to consistently deem some types of
information to be more important than others, while powerless
individuals tend to weigh out different types of information
equally (Guinote 2015). To sum it up, power enables beamformed and
directed attention, inhibition of distracting information and flexible
processing. In contrast, a lack of power results in reduced cognitive
control. They are prone to interference and unwanted influences (Guinote
2015).

Lastly, If power results in situated variability, how can one reconcile
the major trends in which power holders act? Stability in the behaviour
of power holders comes from chronically accessible constructs such as
dispositions and goals. However, these constructs often compete with the
temporarily accessible ones stimulated by environmental cues. So, in the
absence of external cues, power holders act in line with their
dispositions and motivations, but in the presence of external elements,
they move further away from their dispositions than powerless
individuals.

To sum it up, power ensures efficiency in all the components of the
cognitive arsenal enabling fast judgement and action, propmt decision
making and relentless pursuit of goals. Thus, the very presence of power
(or lack thereof) can alter the way we understand and respond to the
world. (Dépret and Fiske 1993)

Power and the Role of Trust 
---------------------------

So far, we have seen how possessing/not possessing power can have an
impact on our minds. But, how does our mind interpret a third person in
a position of power (or the lack thereof)? Experiments have shown that
participants in the high-power condition were significantly less
trusting. Furthermore, having low power amplifies people's hope that
their exchange partner will turn out to be benevolent, which then leads
to their decision to trust (Martin Reimann, n.d.).

So, why does this happen? This can be explained with the help of
*motivated cognition* ("Motivated Cognition," n.d.). Motivated cognition
refers to the bias of personal motives in various types of thought
processes such as memory, information processing, reasoning, judgment,
and decision making. Such motivational biases persist due to critical
psychological needs. We have seen before that people in powerless
positions are usually in a defensive emotional state pertaining to their
lack of cognitive control. Thus, they are motivated to see their
powerful counterpart as more trustworthy in order to avoid the anxiety
inherently attached to their feelings of dependence. This enables people
to protect their limited emotional resources and protect themselves from
constant survival thoughts. Powerful people don't trust as easy because,
as we have seen earlier, they are often in a positive emotional state
and utilise their cognitive resources to maintain cognitive control.

Thus, these positive illusions tend to dominate over reasoned decision
making in a social setup (i.e., system 1 response via trust over system
2 response), allowing power to persist and maintain cohesion in power
relations. This also highlights the importance of resistance (Raj, n.d.)
within a social setup because the populous can become disillusioned by
the ones with power.
