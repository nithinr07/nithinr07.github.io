    content: >-
      I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at [IIIT Bangalore](https://iiitb.ac.in). I love to use my varied technical skills for social good. I also write articles analysing phenomena in technological spaces with the help of social lenses.
